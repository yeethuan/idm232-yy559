Cut off and discard the ends of the radishes; thinly slice into rounds. Place in a bowl and top with the juice of 1 lime wedge and a drizzle of olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Stir to coat. In a bowl, combine the ponzu sauce, sweet chili sauce, sugar, 1/4 cup of water, and as much of the soy marinade as you\'d like.*Cook the rice ^^ In a medium pot, combine the rice, a big pinch of salt, and 1 1/2 cups of water; heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook 12 to 14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Turn off the heat and fluff with a fork. Cover to keep warm.*Cook the steaks ^^ While the rice cooks, pat the steaks dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper on both sides. In a large pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned steaks and cook 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare, or until browned and cooked to your desired degree of doneness. Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a cutting board and let rest for at least 5 minutes.*Cook the vegetables ^^ While the steaks rest, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the pan of reserved fond; heat on medium-high until hot. Add the quartered mushrooms in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly browned and slightly softened. Add the sliced shallot and chopped ginger; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant.*Glaze the vegetables ^^ Add the glaze and chopped bok choy to the pan; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes, or until the glaze is slightly thickened and the vegetables have softened. Turn off the heat and stir in the juice of the remaining lime wedges. Season with salt and pepper to taste.*Slice the steaks &amp; serve your dish ^^ Find the lines of muscle (or grain) on the rested steaks; thinly slice crosswise against the grain. Serve the sliced steaks with the cooked rice and glazed vegetables. Garnish with the marinated radishes (draining before adding).
